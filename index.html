				<h2>Why I chose HDT</h2>

				<p>I have always enjoyed solving problems related to math, computer science or logic. I pursued this
					path during high school and university with a Bachelor of Computer Science. This path gave me solid
					foundations for my future career in this field. On the other hand, I like when I do something
					interesting, which has a real impact and it is not just another technology in the company, which is
					another variation of the same problem. That brought me
					to this program, as healthcare is currently in the phase of digitalization and correct influence and
					cooperation with the right people could change the lives of the masses.
				</p>


				<h2>Me as a learner</h2>

				<p>Whenever I study or do assignments I do it spontaneously, I do not plan a concrete structure for my
					day or week, but I rather do tasks when I feel I am in the correct mood for that work. Moreover,
					with approaching deadlines, I dedicate more time to that specific task. I can see some flaws in this
					technique, but so far it worked great for me. Every time I do something, I do it on 100%, so I
					always finish
					my work on time but I need specific deadlines because the pressure of time gives me motivation to
					continue on the work.
				</p>

				<p>
					The best technique that has always worked for me during studying sessions is studying with visual
					aids. With a grain of salt, whenever I see something I will never forget. Layouts, colors and
					patterns will always stick in my head. This includes graphs, videos, pictures
					and many other forms. To learn practical things I always stand for the opinion that to learn a
					specific task it is necessary to do that specific task. For example, it is not possible to learn how
					to program by listening to lectures about programming, but it is important to sit behind the
					computer and try to make a computer program and use lectures and videos as a source of help when new
					problems arise during programming.

				<h2>Thought process behind selection of learning goals</h2>
				<p>As I am studying for my master's degree, I have experienced many different situations during my life
					which helped me to
					shift my direction toward my dream job. I am still a student but I have a quite clear vision of my
					future but there are still loose ends in specific details and there are always things which could be
					improved regardless of the journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					After these few weeks of studying at Maastricht University, I realized that the university is
					completely different in comparison to my university in the Czech Republic. I am not saying it is
					better or
					worse, just different. The main difference lies in the teaching process, it is not about "how" but
					about "the journey". During my bachelor's, I learned a lot of hard skills in the mathematical and
					computer
					science field. I can feel that Maastricht University teaches the other part. What do I mean by this
					sentence? The focus is more on communication a cooperation in a given environment, specifically for
					example - how to influence different people and communicate with stakeholders, to gain an advantage
					of that. I have realized that these are also important skills and I did not give them a lot of
					attention as I have not thought about them.

					To address this "problem" I visited the "Discover your competencies" workshop held by Career Centrum
					at Maastricht University to learn more about skills I know and, moreover to discover things I could
					know but do not.

					The workshop pointed out information about whom I was aware of. I knew that I enjoy technical
					problems and this field but it forced me to think about which section of this field I would like to
					pursue. During the conversations with participants of the workshop, it was pointed out that.
					I could probably be able to explain topics to other people.

								To be a successful bridge-builder it is important to be not only an expert in a specific
								domain but also to have an ability to understand the process
								how to bridge the gap between different fields. As my main domain is computer science
								and I
								have a lot of biases about what is and what is not a common knowledge
								from this field. I would like to learn how different types of communication work and how
								to
								share the knowledge. Specifically I would like to learn how to teach
								healthcare professionals about computer science.

								I will conduct three workshops about different topics from computer science with people
								from HDT programme, who would like to attend. During these interactive workshops
								I will collect feedback from my peers and according to the feedback I will change the
								content and structure of the next workshop.

								My goal is to reflect on these workshops and to realize what works and does not. To get
								the realization
								about the engagement, form of content etc.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<p class="smartLetter">M</p>
							<p>
								I will create three workshops and after that, I will write a summary of what I have
								learned. This summary will reflect the feedback from workshops and it is the main goal.
								Practically gain the knowledge what is the correct way of sharing the knowledge. This
								practical style also fits with my learning style, which I like the most.
							</p>

								This process behind this learning goal will put me into the position where the skill of
								bridging the gap is
								essential, it will actively motivate me to work on the next workshop, as the feeling
								of lack of improvement could be noticeable on the mood of participants. It will also
								challenge me to give it an appropriate effort.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<p class="smartLetter">R</p>
							<p>
								The goal is realistic, as conducting workshops will require preparation of material and
								reflection on feedback, but it will take maximum few days. Also as it is possible
								to reserve classrooms at the university, so the place for the workshop will be
								available.

							I would like to get better at presenting the work which was done by me or my team. It is

							As I have not done proper research during my life, I would like to learn how to do it

							This skill is also important for our project, as one of our main goals is to discover

							prescription cascades. As we have a limited
							time for our project, it is sure, that somebody will continue in the research or somebody
							would like to change the process. For this
							purposes it is a great idea to have everything documented according to research practices.

							I will learn how to make the proper research. It means that I will make my own independent
							studying of
							available materials how to do the research and
							I will document the process of the research, make hypothesis and conclusions. Drafts of this

					<h3>Period 1</h3>

					<p>At first it was difficult to create the goals and a lot of time was spent on the realization of
						my
						weak abilities. There were a lot of iterations of the goals but they were finally established
						after
						consultations
						with the coach and in during next periods I will be able to work on them.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<h4>Expert</h4>

					<p>As I plan to the workshops during period 2, during this period I have done research if it will be
						possible to conduct them.
						During this period I talked with my classmates, if
						somebody would
						be interested to attend these workshops and I got positive reactions, that they would like to
						attend. The plan
						for following weeks is to create the presentation for the first workshop, gather the feedback
						from somebody
						who teaches the same of related topic and create the workshops.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<h4>Communicator</h4>

					<p>For this learning goal I want to learn how to present topics to different people. The best way
						how to
						learn the presenting is to
						present. During this period I was able to get the feedback for two presentations and next ones
						will come in next periods.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="partsOfLearningGoalHeadline">Presentation for interdisciplinary project</h5>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<p>
						My part of the <a href="files/Symposium Presentation .pdf">presentation</a> was about the
						explanation
						of prescription cascades and PSSA. Before I went to the presentation I had asked my girlfriend
						for feedback on the presentation.
						She pointed out that I should use more visual aids, that the part about cascades was
						understandable, but picture would help. The same
						applied for the PSSA. According to this feedback I created the visual aids for these topics.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the presentation I felt that the explanation of the topic was pretty clear. For the part
						about cascades the visual
						aid really helped and the continuous adding of another parts of visual aid helped a lot. For
						the other part I felt it could be improved
						and as it is the difficult part about the whole project, even for us, I should have taken more
						time practicing the explanation
						as it is not an easy topic at all. Furthermore, I wrote a lot of speaker notes for the
						presentation, but I found it difficult
						to present and to look at the notes at once, as it is really distracting. Next time I would like
						to try
						implement these notes into the presentation itself,
						so it would blend with the slides and I could use the slides as a structure not only for
						listeners but also for me. During this presentation
						I asked Marieke Spreeuwenberg to give me the <a
							href="files/interdisciplinaryprojectperiod1feedback.txt"> feedback</a> via the questions I
						provided.
						Following quote is my attempt of summarization of the feedback.

					</p>

					<p class="quote">"Overall presentation was good, visual aids were helpful, confusion about the goal
						of the project, difficult to understand PSSA,
						wiggling (body language)."
					</p>



				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<p>
						Even though, I added visual aids it helped only for the part about prescribing cascades and the
						visual aid for PSSA did not helped much.
						What I am taking from this part is, that it is important to select proper visualization, as not
						every visualization is not suitable
						for given problem. It is just a simple statement from me, but I know that I will give it more
						time in the future. Also I will focus more
						on the main message of the presentation, maybe to always create a slide in the beginning about
						the goals and structure.
						Regardless the wiggling and standing behind the desk, I also noticed it a little bit,
						but it is hard to switch between slides and actively explaining something in front of the
						projector. For simple slideshow it is possible to ask for help
						of a colleague. On the other hand, it is not suitable for switching the visual aids every few
						seconds as it can distract the flow of the presentation.
						For this purpose I was searching how to solve this issue and
						discovered a tool called "presenter" and bought myself one. This tool will enable me to stand in
						front of my slides and actively change them
						without the need of going to the laptop. I will try to use it in the next presentations in
						following periods. Also I will focus more on actively looking
						on the crowd.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="partsOfLearningGoalHeadline">Presentation about analysis of data</h5>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<p>
						Next chance to present was the next day, where we presented our project about analysis heart
						diseases in the USA. My part of the <a
							href="files/pythonprojectpresentation.pdf">presentation</a>
						was the data cleaning and first sub-question about demographics. As we presented only results,
						it
						means plotting the graph and presenting that graph,
						there was not a good opportunity to get better at visual aids, but I will focus on it more in
						the
						next period. Still I tried to make the presentation more appealing and understandable using
						visual aids, to think more about layout and the main message of each slide and I think it was
						better than the day before.
						On the other hand, I mostly, I focused on
						my body language and eye contact with the crowed. Before the presentation I also asked my
						classmate for
						<a href="files/pythonpresentationfeedback.txt">feedback</a> with focus on appearance of
						visualization and eye contact with the crowd.
						Feedback confirmed, that the visualization were clear and I mostly kept eye contact with the
						crowd, but it was also mentioned,
						that there were parts where I was looking to much at the slides and I also used to much "uhm"
						words. It is a positive thing
						to see the improvement in using the eye contact. I tried to stay away from the computer in front
						of the slides and it helped
						me, as I was able to be more opened. I will see if it will be even better as now I have the
						presenter for next opportunities.
						Removing the "uhm" words will take a little bit of time and praxis and it should disappear in
						next presentations but I will keep
						an eye on it, if it will be improving.
					</p>

					<p>
						As this was a feedback from my classmate, I am wondering if the feedback has same value. I mean
						it in a way, that tutors usually can
						point out more mistakes, but by this feedback I was assured about the improvement of eye contact
						and I
						will look forward for feedback at the end
						of period 2, where I will be able to present presentation about our advancements in
						interdisciplinary project. At that occasion I will be
						able to collect feedback from the same person and this will help me to remove biases from
						opinions from different people.
					</p>

					<p>
						I am glad that I got these feedbacks, because during next presentations I will be able to focus
						on these problems
						and next feedbacks will validate if I am getting better or I should try different techniques.

				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<p>
						CV is the first thing people see during the application process for a job. So it is necessary to
						have it in the best possible shape. To improve it, I attended a workshop, because I already had
						a CV but I wanted to make it better.
						During this workshop we were discussing different ideas how the CV should look like and how to
						include
						different things
						in it. But the most interesting part was the feedback from other participants of the workshop.
						Printed CVs
						were going in circle to the next person every one minute, so everybody was able to write the
						first idea on
						the sticky note
						about the other CV and send the CV to the next person. During this workshop I gathered few
						ideas,
						how I could improve my CV. In the included pictures it is possible to see the result before and
						after.
						There are no major changes, but I implemented advice from feedback into my CV and make
						individual
						sections better.
						Changes were done in the profile, where I focused more on my personality instead of repeating
						the information from other sections;
						hobbies were added to give the CV a little bit of personality; skills were grouped into two
						groups - soft and hard skills;
						german language was added even though I am a beginner. I have thought about the feedback and
						gained knowledge and I like the final result
						more. Even small changes can make a difference.

						<h5 class="partsOfLearningGoalHeadline">How to build a startup</h5>
						<p>To achieve something and make a change, it is important to know the right people, to have an
							ability
							to create new connections with unknown people from different fields. That is the reason I
							attended
							the meeting with organization START. Where I had an opportunity to talk with open minded
							students
							and also listen to presentation about "How to start a startup". The presentation surprised me
							a
							lot.
							I expected that starting a startup is not an easy task, but it pointed out different steps
							about which I
							would not
							think about and also enhanced the realization, that knowing the right people is
							much
							more important
							than being the best at something. During the presentation there were breaks for workshop
							elements, when
							we were designing a plan for startups which people pitched. It was an enlightening experience
							to
							listen
							to the ideas and actually be a part of the process. I always dreamed to start a company, but
							when I was listening
							and also experiencing how much work and different backgrounds it takes, I will probably need
							to
							postpone the idea.
							I realized that there are a lot of uncertainties, where I need a little bit of experience.
							I like the
							innovation, which I would like
							to do in the company which I would start, but after this experience I am starting to think
							to
							join
							an already established
							group which would give me the framework and guidance at first and only then I will be able
							to
							do it on my own.
						</p>

						<p>
							The second half of the event was the networking part, when at first I felt the feeling I
							knew that I
							will
							feel.
							The weird feeling about how to approach new people. I have always found this difficult but I
							was
							positively
							surprised that it was not that difficult. People who attend these meeting have the mind set
							into
							the "accepting" mood.
							They are there for the reason, that they want to connect and are opened to it. So I met a
							lot
							of people from different
							environments and had few interesting conversations.
						</p>

						<p>
							The idea which I took from this experience is the fact, that these events are there for a
							reason.
							That it is difficult for a lot of people to make connections. But at these events people are
							opened
							at it is much easier to connect and also to enlighten own mind from the other ideas. So next
							time I
							know
							that I can go straight to the first random person and start a conversation.
						</p>

						<p>
							As the meeting was held by students for students. There were not many people from higher
							management positions. So next time, when I will attend a networking event, I will be probably looking for event with
							different
							people. This settings
							could shift the environment and also the opportunities. But I see this networking event as a
							great first step, because
							I can use the gain experience in future decision making.

					<h4>Meeting 1</h4>

					<p>
						First meeting with UM Coach was mostly about discussing the learning goals. At the beginning I
						did not correctly grasps the idea of learning goals
						and focus they should target. When I thought about the goals I had previously, they were
						"boring" in a sense, that they did not require active participation.
						There contained listening to podcasts, reading and other passive activities. Moreover, they
						were little bit off the direction of this program. After this meeting
						I gave it a little bit more of additional thought and completely changed by goals, because I had
						a feeling that radical change needs to be done. I thought about my initial learning goals but after 
						this meeting I realized, that I need to think more and differently to select them properly.
					</p>

					<p>
						After this meeting I realized how the education system is completely different comparing to my
						bachelor and I needed some time to adapt myself. Previous learning goals
						corresponded with my previous education and at this university, they have a different point of
						view. So the learning goals needed to be rethought to be aligned with this
						point of view. I know it will be a rewarding experience as in education there is usually no
						right or wrong path, but it is possible to learn from every system. At the end,
						the combination of both views is the correct one. I am looking forward what this different system
						will be able to offer and how it will shift my thinking process.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<h4>Meeting 2</h4>

					<p>
						Second meeting was about discussing new learning goals. Expert goal stayed the same as it is
						now. On the other hand, small changes were done
						to remaining three learning goals to give them their final format. For Investigator role I wanted
						to learn how to make a research as it is one part of our project, but I did not know
						how to correctly formulate it. During the conversation the coach gave me few sources to read
						through and then during our project I will correctly apply this obtained knowledge.
						For communicator I wanted to learn how to present something to stakeholders, that remain almost
						unchanged, only formulation and clarification of goal was done. For the last one,
						the Professional, I had a lot of ideas, which belonged to almost same category - making a better
						CV, cover letter, networking - but I did not know how to make a learning goal from that.
						After the conversation, the learning goal was established as in few words as "Learn how to
						present myself". That is something which I would like to achieve and it suits the mentioned elements
						well. After this meeting I had my finalized learning goals and I can pursue them now. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Both meetings were really helpful, because I had opportunities to rethink my learning goals
						and to give them their final shape. Now I can focus only on achieving them in following periods.

				<h3>Period 2</h3>

				<p>In second period I continued in pursing the goals. The most important and biggest step was conducting a workshop about SQL.
				</p>

				<h4>Expert</h4>

				<p>Before creating the first workshop I wanted to approach few people to ask them about their experience how to conduct workshops but then 
					I realized that I would like to create my own style. Also I could get a lot of biases from their point of view. Moreover, I am a student now,
					so I know what I like and what I don't like. So I focused on my experience from different kind of workshops and tried to recreate them.
				</p>

				<p>
					As my workshop was not part of a regular schedule it was important to find a place and time for the workshop. Place was quite simple, as I was 
					able to reserve a room at university campus. For the time I used when2meet.com website. During my bachelor we used this a lot I had a great experience with that.
					
					With the help of this site I was able to find a timeslot, when 9 of 11 people had free time - <a href="https://www.when2meet.com/?27430204-lN6kf">survey</a> This was a great choice 
					because when I looked on other dates, even thought a lot of options was provided there were not so successful.

					During the first two month I had two main problems related to technical subjects and workshops in general.

					<ol>
						<li>Workshops are like normal lectures followed by long practical part</li>
						<li>There is a lot of talking in general but people cannot use it</li>
					</ol>

				</p>

				<p>
					Whenever I had a workshop during master studies it was quite difficult to follow tasks which were given, as I did not correctly remember everything what was said.
					Also as the tasks were long without showing "correct" answers it was hard to adapt. Also some workshops lacked the practical part. Moreover tutorials about Technology in Healthcare 
					were about "talking about technologies" which does not help at all in understanding the topic - as everybody can use a lot of fancy words without understanding the topic.

					These were two main points I wanted to improve in my first workshop. I created a <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGVt7IGutY/1v_pvVuYeEU8cxkUe-0O9w/view?utm_content=DAGVt7IGutY&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor">presentation</a> about the topic which supported
					my workshop and I tried to focus on a practical engagement from the first second which would be done by small pieces. Everything which I explained was immediately done in a practical manner. I tried to talk about a topic for maximum 
					3 minutes. This worked perfectly. Everybody managed to solve all exercises without any problems. Before the workshop I thought that it will be hard for people to understand. The result of the workshop surprised me.
					Attendees were able to learn basics of SQL and in my opinion it is more than half of knowledge about SQL, which they will ever need in their life as medical professionals or researches.
				</p>

				<p>
					I also conducted a <a href="./files/Workshop1feedback.csv">feedback form</a>  to get a point of view from the other side. Overall average mark was 4.87 out of 5, which exceeded my expectations and I am glad that people enjoyed that. 
					Moreover, it pointed out, that practical part worked and people learned a lot and there was a nice atmosphere to ask questions and dive more into the details. On the other hand it also pointed out things which could be better, I was also talking 
					with people after the workshop, so not everything is in the form. In the next workshop I would like to improve settings into the context and how can be SQL used with other technologies - for example how can we access and ask database from python with help of SQL.
					The other thing was to add more different activities to the workshop, as sometimes people forgot the name of the keyword or order of commands. It would be nice to include random questions for example via Kahoot. This would change to flow of the workshop a little bit help people to solidify the knowledge.  
				</p>

				<p>Overall I am satisfied with workshop and I am glad that me thinking process how to make the workshop great worked and I will stick to that. Of course, I will take also take possible improvements into account and I will try to use them in the next workshop.</p>

				<h4>Professional</h4>

				<p>As I had already visited a workshop about "How to make a good CV" in period 1, this period I attended workshop about cover letter. When I was at a workshop about CV 
				I had a feeling, that my CV is overall great - I only did small changes. I cannot say the same about my cover letter, in comparison to other people, I saw, that I need to dedicate more work 
			towards my cover letter. I also learned what should cover letter include at what it should not.  </p>

				<p>
					In addition to that, I visited an event organized by association from Business faculty about how to make a good pitch. I met there two people from last networking event, which was really nice and refreshing. During the whole 
					event I had a lot of opportunities to talk to different people. In comparison to last networking part, at the meeting I knew there is nothing to be scared of, so I talked to a lot of people without hesitation. That was a nice improvement. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>On 27th of November I had opportunity to use all gained skills at the final-round interview for a Software Engineer Intern at Microsoft. I passed all previous round in the previous months and this final round contained 3 45-minutes interviews with different people.
				The CV helped me to gain the attention and be selected for the first round but in this final-round I answered technical questions, did a lot of programming and last and not least talking about my past. I used gained information about pitching from the event 
				and used them effectively. Results of the work speak for themselves as I got a call from Microsoft on 2nd of December with an offer for Software Engineer Intern role. 
				I will be a part of the team which is developing Microsoft Teams.
