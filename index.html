				<h2>Why I chose HDT</h2>

				<p>I have always enjoyed solving problems related to math, computer science or logic. I pursued this
					path during high school and also at the university at bachelor of Computer
					Science. This path gave me solid foundations for my future career in this field. On the other hand I
					like when I do something in interesting, which has real impact and it is not
					another technology in the company, which is another variation of the same problem. That brought me
					to this program, as the healthcare is currently in the phase of digitalization
					and correct influence and cooperation with right people could change lives of masses.
				</p>


				<h2>Me as a learner</h2>

				<p>Whenever I study or do assignments I do it spontaneously, I do not plan a concrete structure of my
					day or week, but I rather do tasks when I feel I am in correct
					mood for that work. Moreover, with approaching deadlines I dedicate more time to that specific task.
					I can see some flaws in this technique, but so far I worked great for me.
					Everytime I do something, I do it on 100 %, so I finish my work on time but I need specific
					deadlines because the pressure of time gives me motivation to continue on the work.
				</p>

				<p>
					Best techniques which always worked for me during studying sessions is studying with visual aids.
					With a grain of salt, whenever I see something I will never forget it, because I see
					because the layout, colors and patterns will always stick in my head. This includes, graphs, videos,
					picture and many other forms. To learn practical things I always stand
					for opinion that to learn specific task it is necessary to do that specific task. For example it is
					not possible to learn how to programm by listening to lectures about programming, but it
					is important to sit behind the computer and try to make a computer program and use lectures and
					videos as a source of help when new problem arrise during programming.

				<h2>Thought process behind selection of learning goals</h2>
				<p>As I am studying my master degree, I have experienced different situations which helped me to shift
					my direction toward my dream job. I am still a student but I have
					a quite clear vision about my future but there are still loose ends about specific details and there
					are always things which could be improved regarthless the journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					After these few weeks of studing at Maastricht University I realized that the university is
					completly different than my university in the Czech Republic. I am not saying it
					is better or worse, just different. Main difference lays in the teaching process, it is not about
					"how" but about "what". During my bachelor I learned a lot of hard skills in the mathematical
					and computer science field. I can feel that Maastricht University teaches the other part. What do I
					mean by this sentence? The focus is more on communication a cooperation
					in a given environment, specifically for example - how to influence different people, communication
					with stakeholders, how to gain an advantage of that. I have realized that these are
					also important skills and I did not give them a lot of attention as I have not thought about them.

					To address this "problem" I visited "Discover your competencies" workshop held by Carreer Centrum at
					Maastricht University to learn more about skills I know, but moreover to
					discover things I could know but I do not.

					Workshop pointed out information about whose I was aware of. I knew that I enjoy technical problems
					and this field but it forced me to think about which section of this field I would
					like to pursue. During the converstations with particiappnts of the workshop it was pointed out that
					I could probably be able to explain topics to other people

								To be a succesful bridge-builder it is important to be not only an expert in a specific
								domain but also to have an ability to understand the process
								how to bridge the gap between different fields. As my main domain is computer science a
								have a lot of biases about what is and what is not a common knowledge
								from this field. I would like to learn how which types of communication work and how to
								share the knowledge. specifically I would like to learn how to teach
								healthcare professionals about computer science.

								I will conduct three workshops about different topics from computer science with people
								from HDT programm, who would like to attend. On these interactive workshops
								I will collect feedback from my peers and according to the feedback I will change the
								content and structure of the next workshop.

								My goal is to reflect on these workshops and to realize what works and does not.

								I will create three workshops and after that I will write a short summary of what I have

							As I have not done proper research during my life, I would like to learn how to do it

							It is also important for our project, as one of our main goal is to discover different
							prescription cascades. As we have limited
							time for our project it is sure, that somebody will continue in the research or somebody
							would like to change the process. For this
							purposes it is a great idea to have everything document according to research practices.

							I will learn how to make the proper research, I will make my own independent studying of
							available materials how to do the research and
							I will document the process of the research, make hypotesis and conslusions. Drafts of this
							process will be consulted with my UM Coach.

					<h3>Period 1</h3>

					<p>At first it was difficult to create the goals and a lot of time was spended on the realization of
						my
						weak abilities. There were a lot of iterations but the goals were finally established after
						consulations
						with the coach and in the next period I will be able to work on them.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<h4>Expert</h4>

					<p>I plan to the workshops during period 2. During this period I talked with my classmates, if
						somebody would
						be interested to attend these workshops and I got positive reactions, that they would like to
						attend. The plan
						for following weeks is to create the presentation for the first workshop, gather the feedback
						from somebody
						who teaches the same of related topic and create the workshops.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<h4>Communicator</h4>

					<p>For this goal i want to learn how to present topics to different people. The best way how to
						learn the presenting is to
						present. During this period I was able to get the feedback for two presentations and next ones
						will come in next periods.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="partsOfLearningGoalHeadline">Presentation for interdisciplinary project</h5>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<p>
						My part of the <a href="files/Symposium Presentation .pdf">presentation</a> was about the explanation
						of prescription cascades and PSSA. Before I went to the presentation I asked my girlfriend to
						give me the feedback on the presentation.
						She pointed out that I should use more visual aids, that the part about cascades was
						understandable, but picture would help. The same
						applied for the PSSA. According to this feedback I created the visual aids for these topics.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the presentation I felt that the explanation of the topic was pretty clear. For the part
						about cascades the visual
						aid really helped and the the continuous adding of another parts of visual aid helped a lot. For
						the other part I felt it could be improved
						and as it is the difficult part about the whole project even for us, I should have taken more
						time practicing the explanation
						as it is not an easy topic at all. Furthermore, I wrote a lot of speaker notes for the
						presentation, but I found it difficult
						to present and look at the notes, as it is really distructing. Next time I would like to try
						implement these notes into the presentation itself,
						so it would blend with the slides and I could use the slides as a structure not only for
						listeners but also for me. During this presentation
						I asked Marieke Spreeuwenberg to give me the <a href="files/interdisciplinaryprojectperiod1feedback.txt"> feedback</a> via the questions I provided.
						Following quote is my attempt for summirization of the feedback.

					</p>

					<p class="quote">"Overall presentation was good, visual aids were helpful, confusion about the goal
						of the project, difficult to understand PSSA,
						wiggling (body language)."
					</p>



				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<p>
						Even though, I added visual aids it helped only for the part about prescribing cascades and the
						visual aid for PSSA did not helped much.
						What I am taking from this part is, that it is important to select proper visualization, as not
						every visualization is not suitable
						for given problem. It is just a simple statement from me, but I know that I will give it more
						time in the future. Also I will focus more
						on the main message of the presentation, maybe to always create a slide in the beginning.
						Regardless the wiggling and standing behind the desk, I also noticed it a little bit,
						but it is hard to switch between slides and actively explaning something in front of the
						projector. For simple slide show it is possible to ask for help
						of a collegue, but for switching of visual aid every few seconds it is not sustainable. For this
						purpose I was searching how to solve this issue and
						discovered a tool called presenter and bought myself one. This tool will enable me to stand in
						front of my slides and actively change them
						without the need of going to the laptop. I will try to use it in the next presentations in
						following periods. Also I will focus more on actively looking
						on the crowd.

				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="partsOfLearningGoalHeadline">Presentation about analysis of data</h5>
				</div>

				<div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
					<p>
						Next chance to present was the next day, where we presented our project about analysis of the data
						of heart diseases in the USA. My part of the <a href="files/pythonprojectpresentation.pdf">presentation</a>
						was the data cleaning and first subquestion about demographics. As we presented only results, so it
						means plotting the graph and presenting that graph,
						there was not a good opportunity to get better at visual aids, but I will focus on it more in the
						next period. Still I tried to make the presentation more appealing and understandable using visual aids. Mostly, I focused on
						my body language and eye contact with the crowed. Before the presentation I also asked my classmate for
						<a href="files/pythonpresentationfeedback.txt">feedback</a> with focus on on appearance of visualization and eye contact with the crowd.
						Feedback confirmed, that the visualization were clear and I mostly kept eye contact with the crowd, but it was also mentioned,
						that there were parts where I was looking to much at the slides and I also used to much "uhm" words. It is a possitive thing
						to see the improvement in using the eye contact. I tried to stay away from the computer in front of the slides and it helped 
						me, as I was able to be more opened. I will see if it will be even better as now I have the presenter for next opportunities.
						Removing the "uhm" words will take a little bit of time and praxis and should dissappeare in next presentation, but I will keep
						an eye on it, if it will be improving.
					</p>

					<p>
						As this was a feedback from my classmate, I am wondering if the feedback has same value. I mean it in a way, that tutors usually can 
						point out more mistakes, but by this feedback I was assured about the improvement of eye and I will look forward for feedback at the end 
						of period 2, where I will be able to present presentation about our advancements in interdisciplinary project. At that occassion I will be 
						able to collect feedback from the same person and this will help me to remove biases from opinions from different people.

					<p>
						CV is the first thing people see when I would like to apply for a job. So it is necessary to
						have it in the best possible shape. I already had a CV, but I wanted to make it better. During
						this
						workshop we were discussing different ideas how to CV should look like and how to include
						different things
						in it. But the most interesting part was the feedback from other participants of the workshop.
						Printed CVs
						were going to the next person every one minute, so everybody was able to write the first idea on
						the sticky note
						about the other CV and send the CV to the next person. By this workshop I gathered few ideas,
						how I could improve my CV. In the included pictures it is possible to see the result before and
						after.
						There are no major changes, but I implemented the feedback into the CV and make individual
						sections better.
						Changes were done in the profile, where I focused more on my personality instead of repeating
						the information from other sections;
						hobbies were added to give the CV a little bit of personality; skills were grouped into two
						groups - soft and hard skills;
						german language was added eventhough I am a beginner. I have thought about the feedback and
						gained knowledge and I like the final result
						more. Even small changes can make a difference.

						<h5 class="partsOfLearningGoalHeadline">How to build a startup</h5>
						<p>To achieve something and make a change it is important to know the right people, to have an
							ability
							to create new connections with unknown people from different fields. That is the reason I
							attended
							the meeting with organization START. Where I had an opportunity to talk with open minded
							students
							and also listen to presentation about "How to start a startup". The presentation suprised me
							a
							lot.
							I expected that starting a startup is not an easy talk, but it pointed out different steps I
							would not
							think about them and also enhanced the the realization, that knowing the right people is
							much
							more important
							than being the best at something. During the presentation there were breaks for workshop
							elements, where
							we were designing a plan for startups which people pitched. It was an enlighting experience
							to
							listen
							to the ideas and actually be a part in the process. I always dreamed to start a company, but
							when I was listening
							and also experiencing how much work and different backgrounds it takes, I will probably need
							to
							postpone the idea.
							I realized that there are a lot of uncertainities, which I need to work more. I like the
							innovation, which I wanted
							to do in the company which I would start, but after this experience I starting to think to
							join
							an already established
							group which would give me the framework and guidence at first and only then I would be able
							to
							do it on my own.
						</p>

						<p>
							The second half was the networking event, when at first I felt the feeling I knew that I
							will
							feel.
							The weird feeling to approach new people. I have always found this difficult but I was
							possitively
							suprised that it was not that difficult. People who attend these meeting have the mind set
							into
							the accepting mood.
							There are there for the reason, that they want to connect and are opened to it. So I met a
							lot
							of people from different
							environments and had few interesting converstations.
						</p>

						<p>
							The idea which I took from this experience is the fact, that these events are there for a
							reason.
							That it is difficult for a lot of people to make connections. But at these events people are
							opened
							at it is much easier to connect and also enlighten own mind from the other ideas. So next
							time I
							know
							that I can straight go to the first random person and start a converstation.
						</p>

						<p>
							As the meeting for held by students for students. There were not many people from higher
							management positions,
							so next time, when I will attend a networking event, I will be looking for event with
							different
							people. This settings
							could shift the environment and also the opportunities. But I see this networking event as a
							great first step, because
							I can use the gain experience in future decison making.

					<h4>Meeting 1</h4>

					<p>
						First meeting with UM coach was mostly about discussing the learning goals. At the beginning I did not correctly grasps the idea of learning goals 
						and focus they should target. When I thought about the goals I had previously, they were "boring" in a sence, that they not required active participations.
						There contained listening to podcasts, reading and other passive acitivities. Moreover, they were little bit off the direction of this program. After this meeting 
						I gave it a little bit more of additional thought and completly changed by goals, because I had a feeling that radical change needs to be done. 
					</p>

					<p>
						After this meeting I realized how the education system is completly different comparing to my bachelor and I needed some time to adapt myself. Previous learning goals
						correspended with my previous education and at this university, they have a different point of view. So the learning goal needed to be rethouted to be alligned with this 
						point of view. I know it will be a rewarding experience as in education there is usually no right or wrong path but it is possible to learn from every system. At the end 
						the combination of both view is the correct one. I am looking forward what this different system will be able to offer and shift my thinking process.

					<h4>Meeting 2</h4>

					<p>
						Second meeting was about discussing new learning goals. Expert goals stayed the same as it is now. On the other hand, small changes were done 
						to remaming three learning goals to give them their final format. For Investigator role I wanted to learn how to make a research as our project is about it, but I did not know 
						how to correctly formulate it. During the converstation the coach gave me few sources to read through and then during our project correctly apply research methods.
						For communicator I wanted to learn how to present something to stakeholders, that remain almost unchanged, only formulation and clarification of goal was done. For the last one,
						the Professional, I had a lot of ideas, which belonged to almsot same category - making a better CV, cover letter, networking - but I did not know how to make a learning goal from that.
						After the conversation, the learning goal was established as in few words as "Learn how to present myself". That is something which I would like to achieve and suits the single elements 
						well. 
					</p>

					<p>
						After this meeting I had my finalized learning goals and I can pursue them now. The meetings were really helpful, because I had opportunities to rethink my learning goals 
						and to give them their final shape. Now I can focus only on achieving them in following periods.
