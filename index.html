				<h2>Why I chose HDT</h2>

				<p>I have always enjoyed solving problems related to math, computer science or logic. I pursued this path during high school and also at the university at bachelor of Computer
				   Science. This path gave me solid foundations for my future career in this field. On the other hand I like when I do something in interesting, which has real impact and it is not
				   another technology in the company, which is another variation of the same problem. That brought me to this program, as the healthcare is currently in the phase of digitalization
				   and correct influence and cooperation with right people could change lives of masses.
				</p>


				<h2>Me as a learner</h2>

				<p>Whenever I study or do assignments I do it spontaneously, I do not plan a concrete structure of my day or week, but I rather do tasks when I feel I am in correct
					mood for that work. Moreover, with approaching deadlines I dedicate more time to that specific task. I can see some flaws in this technique, but so far I worked great for me.
					Everytime I do something, I do it on 100 %, so I finish my work on time but I need specific deadlines because the pressure of time gives me motivation to continue on the work.
				</p>

				<p>
					Best techniques which always worked for me during studying sessions is studying with visual aids. With a grain of salt, whenever I see something I will never forget it, because I see
					because the layout, colors and patterns will always stick in my head. This includes, graphs, videos, picture and many other forms. To learn practical things I always stand
					for opinion that to learn specific task it is necessary to do that specific task. For example it is not possible to learn how to programm by listening to lectures about programming, but it
					is important to sit behind the computer and try to make a computer program and use lectures and videos as a source of help when new problem arrise during programming.

				<h2>Thought process behind selection of learning goals</h2>
				<p>As I am studying my master degree, I have experienced different situations which helped me to shift my direction toward my dream job. I am still a student but I have
					a quite clear vision about my future but there are still loose ends about specific details and there are always things which could be improved regarthless the journey.
				</p>
				<p>
					After these few weeks of studing at Maastricht University I realized that the university is completly different than my university in the Czech Republic. I am not saying it 
					is better or worse, just different. Main difference lays in the teaching process, it is not about "how" but about "what". During my bachelor I learned a lot of hard skills in the mathematical
					and computer science field. I can feel that Maastricht University teaches the other part. What do I mean by this sentence? The focus is more on communication a cooperation
					in a given environment, specifically for example - how to influence different people, communication with stakeholders, how to gain an advantage of that. I have realized that these are 
					also important skills and I did not give them a lot of attention as I have not thought about them.

					To address this "problem" I visited "Discover your competencies" workshop held by Carreer Centrum at Maastricht University to learn more about skills I know, but moreover to
					discover things I could know but I do not. 

					Workshop pointed out information about whose I was aware of. I knew that I enjoy technical problems and this field but it forced me to think about which section of this field I would
					like to pursue. During the converstations with particiappnts of the workshop it was pointed out that I could probably be able to explain topics to other people

								To be a succesful bridge-builder it is important to be not only an expert in a specific domain but also to have an ability to understand the process
								how to bridge the gap between different fields. As my main domain is computer science a have a lot of biases about what is and what is not a common knowledge
								from this field. I would like to learn how which types of communication work and how to share the knowledge. specifically I would like to learn how to teach
								healthcare professionals about computer science.

								I will conduct three workshops about different topics from computer science with people from HDT programm, who would like to attend. On these interactive workshops
								I will collect feedback from my peers and according to the feedback I will change the content and structure of the next workshop.

								My goal is to reflect on these workshops and to realize what works and does not.	
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<p class="smartLetter">M</p>
							<p>
								I will create three workshops and after that I will write a short summary of what I have learned. This summary will reflect the feedback from workshops and it is the main goal.
								Practically gain the knowledge what is the correct way of sharing the knowledge. This practical style also fits with my learning style, which I like the most.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<p class="smartLetter">A</p>
							<p>
								This learning goal with put me into the position where the skill of bridging the gap is essential, it will actively motivate me to work on the next workshop, as the feeling
								of lack of improvement could be noticeble on participants. It will also challenge me to really give it a time.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<p class="smartLetter">R</p>
							<p>
								The goal is realistic, as conducting workshops will require preparation of material and reflection on feedback, but it will take maximum few days. Also as it is possible
							to reserve classrooms at the university, place for the workshop will be available.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<p class="smartLetter">T</p>
							<p>
								At least two workshops would be held during period 2, last one would be either in period 2 or in period 3. It would
								depend on the availibility of participants.

							I would like to get better at presenting the work which was done by me or my team. IT is important to not only have a wonderful project and results
							but also to have an abillity to influence other people, that the work we have done is significant and has an influence.  During the duration of 
							the programm there are multiple occassions where it is possible to present the work. I will take a stand on every of this occassion and I will collect
							feedback from at least one listener and improve the next presentation. This goal includes the ability to create presentation but also the process of
							presenting in front of multiple people. My goal is to remove every negative thing or activity from presenting which I will receive from listeners.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div>
						<p class="smartLetter">M</p>

							The master program contains a lot of opportunities to present something, so it is possible to gather diverse feedback from different people and different presentation
							topics. To prepare a usually requires a single day, so it is possible to reserve a time for it.

						   For this reason it is important to know yourself very well, know the limits, strengths and competencies. Furthermore,
