It was possible to see content of the slides
yes it was really clear and nicely formatted, one was a little bit confusing


Visualization helped to understand the topic
absolutely! helped with understanding. The visual cross for example really works with the understanding. 


Presenter kept eye contact with the audience during the presentation
Yes you looked well into the room and tried to look well at everyone, sometimes a bit too much t the slide but in general well done to look into the room and make eye-contact. You did really well during the conclusion section


Message from the presentation was clear
Clearly conveyed! everyone was clear, next you time you can focus a bit on getting rid of some stop words like (‘uhm’) it wasn’t too much but always good to lessen it in general


Parts which had loose ends and should be described differently
No


General impression
Good presentation, with clear visuals, well spoken

What should be improved
Mentioned in previous sections.
